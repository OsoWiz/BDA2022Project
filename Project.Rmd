# Introduction
This is a project report for BDA course of edition 2022

# Problem description
Our problem is how are tornado injuries related to the magnitude of the tornado in the US. Additionally we analyzed whether the state the tornado was in had impact. 
Data was optained from kaggle.com, which provides free to use datasets for different purposes. The data contained a lot of extra columns that were unnecessary for our problem, and were hence trimmed.
Naturally there are tons of analysises for tornadoes, as they have a huge impact on societies experiencing them. However we were unable to find any analysis using bayesian statistics for the relation of injuries and magnitude.
